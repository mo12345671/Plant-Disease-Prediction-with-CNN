# Plant-Disease-Prediction-with-CNN
ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project is an AI-powered web app that classifies plant leaf images into different disease categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras.

The model helps farmers and agricultural researchers detect plant diseases early, enabling faster and more accurate treatment decisions.

ðŸ§  Features

âœ… Upload an image of a plant leaf (JPG, PNG, JPEG)
âœ… Get instant predictions of the plantâ€™s disease
âœ… Displays confidence percentage
âœ… Simple and intuitive Streamlit web interface
âœ… Fully deployable in Google Colab and on Streamlit Cloud
